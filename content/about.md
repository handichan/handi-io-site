I’m a postdoctoral associate at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL)](https://eta.lbl.gov/). I earned my PhD in Planning and Public Policy from [Bloustein School](https://bloustein.rutgers.edu), where my research focused on social behavior simulation by combining planning and policy perspectives and quantitativeapproach. I am also an affiliated researcher of the [Rutgers Center for Green Building](http://greenbuilding.rutgers.edu/). Prior to joining LBL, I was a research fellow and a lecturer at [Universitas Tarumanagara](http://http://untar.ac.id/) in my hometown, Jakarta. I mostly write about urban resilience, urban complexity, real estate planning, and building simulation. I realize that I am abit mix of everything, yet, I don’t really like to have my food mixed. I like side dishes. I also prefer to capture landscape and wildlife with my camera, which I share [here](https://instagram.com/chandrahandi).
