## Dashboards and maps
* The CDC has a [coronavirus website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) with up-to-date information and [USA map](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html). 
* The WHO also has a [webpage](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen) dedicated to international events related to coronavirus.
* Google has an [interactive map](https://google.org/crisisresponse/covid19-map) that is updated frequently.
* Penn Medicine has a great hospital impact model ([CHIME](https://penn-chime.phl.io/)) that teaches you a lot about the [sick, infected, and recovered (SIR)](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SIRModel.html) model. Check out the docs. 
* The [Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI)](https://coronavirus-resources.esri.com/) has a wealth of dashboards and data, including the [Johns Hopkins dashboard](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) (see below and find the mobile version [here](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/85320e2ea5424dfaaa75ae62e5c06e61)).
* [Antoine Soetewey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoinesoetewey) wrote an excellent blog post on creating a country-specific [dashboard with R Shiny](https://www.statsandr.com/blog/how-to-create-a-simple-coronavirus-dashboard-specific-to-your-country-in-r/).
* At Storybench, we [interviewed](https://www.storybench.org/how-northeasterns-samuel-scarpino-built-a-live-map-tracking-the-coronavirus-outbreak/) Northeastern’s Samuel Scarpino, assistant professor at the Network Science Institute, about [a map](https://www.healthmap.org/covid-19/) he built tracking the virus.
* The New York Times has [a series of maps](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage&action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage) of the outbreak that it is constantly updating.
* The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has a Covid-19 dashboard.
* USAFacts is [mapping cases](https://qap.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/COVID-19.html) as well. More on their data below.
* The Associated Press is [updating a map](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/tracking-coronavirus-outbreak-us-69797159) twice daily with infections by county:

## Data
* The [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/), a collaboration between The Atlantic, data scientist Jeff Hammerbacher, and a team of volunteers, “collects information from 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and 5 other U.S. territories to provide the most comprehensive testing data we can collect for the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.”
* Reddit has a curated list of coronavirus datasets on [/r/datasets](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/exnzrd/coronavirus_datasets/):
* ESRI also has [an area for sharing data](https://disasterresponse.maps.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=e0140dbc514b48b5b90c351740c14639#overview) on Covid-19.
* Kaggle has also released some new [datasets tagged Covid-19](https://www.kaggle.com/tags/covid19), including [one with “over 44,000 scholarly articles](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)).”
* The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has been publishing [Covid-19 data files].
* USAFacts has been gathering state and local public health data on the virus. As BuzzFeed’s Jeremy Singer-Vine [points out](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2020-03-25-edition) in his rich Data is Plural newsletter, “USAFacts is using data from state governments, local public health agencies, and Johns Hopkins University to map US cases at the county level, with the underlying [data available](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/) to download.”
